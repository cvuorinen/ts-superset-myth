Experimenting with ES2015 -> TypeScript compatibility

To get started:

    npm install


To compile the TypeScript:

    npm run compile
    
To load the examples in the browser:

    npm start
    
Then browse to `http://localhost:7005/`


This example throws compilation errors even though the code is valid ES2016.

Go to the branch `es2015` to see exactly the same code running with Babel/Webpack.
